## Project Proposal
### Project Name: **Railway Ticket Analysis**
### Overview
This project aims to analyze railway ticket sales, delays, and refund requests to identify trends and improve service efficiency. The dataset includes information on ticket purchases, journey times, payment methods, and travel delays.

### Objectives
- Identify peak ticket purchase times.
- Analyze the impact of ticket type on sales.
- Determine the most delayed departure times and stations.
- Evaluate the relationship between journey time and delays.
- Assess the effect of delays on refund requests.

### Scope
- Data collection and cleaning from railway ticket sales records.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Identifying key patterns and trends in delays and refund requests.
- Providing actionable insights to improve railway operations.
